# Set List


This repository serves as an in-class project for Turing's Mod 2 BE program. Through working on this tutorial, students will gain an understanding of and practice the following topics (among others): 
* Model testing
* Migrations
* Feature testing
* MVC
* ActiveRecord & SQL
* Forms

## Setup

Fork/clone or clone this repo. Then, run the following commands in Terminal: 
```
bundle install
rails db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}
```

You should then be able to access the databases called `set_list_development` and `set_list_test`. 

## How to Use
This application starts with schema and corresponding tests for `Artists` and `Songs`. Throughout classes in mod 2, students will be asked to work on adding various features to this application. 

It is recommended that students use the `main` branch of this repo, and add to it on their own machines. There is no need to submit any pull requests to the original repo, as this is a practice application. 

However, students can compare their own work against some completed code, or branch off for the following classes if they wish: 

| Class | Starting Branch | Completed Branch |
|-------|------|------|
|[Songs Index](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4fD_zkHJU) | none | songs_index|
| [Songs Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGZEJWt8qQ) | songs_index | songs_show|
| Feature Testing | `feature_testing_practice`  |
| ActiveRecord Associations | `associations_practice` |
| SQL and ActiveRecord | `associations_practice` |
| Forms | `associations_practice` |
| Class vs Instance Methods | `class_instance_methods_setup` |
| Many to Many | `many_to_many_practice` |
| Joins | `many_to_many` |
| Data Validations | `validations` |
| Sad Path Testing & Flash Messages | `validations` |
| Partials | `many_to_many` (no completed branch) |
| Advanced Routing | `advanced_routing` |
| Grouping & Aggregating | `advanced_routing` (no completed branch) |
| Binding Models to Forms | `main` (no completed branch) |
